Here we have two plots showcasing trends regarding episode quality and how often a writer writes episodes for the show Doctor Who. Essentially I am curious if writers are more likely to be invited bakc on the show if they write episodes that have better ratings. I was also curious if we see a similar trend when accounting for viewership. Bellow are the two visualizations that answer the question, and we see that there is a moderatly positive relationship in viewership and rating.
